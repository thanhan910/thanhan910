### Sidenotes

#### An informal guide to intepreting Vietnamese names

- A Vietnamese full name has a family name - middle name - given name order.
- The family name (surname) is the first consecutive words in the full name. It may or may not exclusively be the first word in the full name.
- The given name is the last consecutive words in the full name. It may or may not exclusively be the last word in the full name.
- The middle name may or may not exist in the full name.

For example: 
- My full name is "Nguyen Thanh An", or "Nguyá»…n ThÃ nh An"
- My surname is "Nguyen"
- My middle name is "Thanh"
- My given name is "An". You can call me "An" or "Thanh An".
